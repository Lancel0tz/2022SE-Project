## Educational Game Development by students in SCNU, ABD, Software Engineering Project Group3
### Title:
“Comprehension and application integrated interactive English learning game”
### Problem: 
In the face of language learning, organizing vocabulary is a long-term study 
and application. From the perspective of children, repetitive knowledge and 
monotonous words are difficult for children to quickly recognize, and there are fewer 
games with positive guidance for younger age groups. At the same time, the public has 
problems such as the monotony of daily live entertainment, the lack of language 
organization, and the limitation of thinking in repetitive life. The fragmented life faced 
by the fast pace also needs such simple but helpful mini-games to fill
### Solution: 
To meet the public's urgent need for language learning, we will make an 
interactive learning game that is both learning and entertaining. The game world will 
set up an all-English environment and create game activities related to learning English. 
The performance brought by the game makes it easy for the public to accept, and the 
immersive English environment enables users to complete the memorization and 
acquisition of English words in a subtle way.
### Objectives: 
Under the premise of ensuring a complete plot line and game experience, 
as well as a complete game physics system, game mechanics, and character design, 
mission function completion. Further expansion and improvement of the game content, 
such as a better UI interface, the start of the home page, more levels and design, more 
gameplay, increase the richness of the game, and make the game more attractive.
### Benefit:
For younger children, it can bring a visual learning process, help associative 
memory, and arouse children's interest. On the other hand, it positively guides the 
child's learning process. Be able to devote more variety and focus to it. Play to promote 
learning. Facing the public can be used as a daily pastime, and on the other hand, it 
leads to multi-angle thinking and the ability to assemble fragmented messages. 
Diverging the boundaries of imagination and activating our thinking logic.
